# Agent Instructions

## Commit message format

All commits must follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

[optional body]
```

### Allowed types
- feat
- fix
- docs
- style
- refactor
- test
- chore
- build
- ci
- perf
- revert

### Rules
- `<scope>` is required and should be a short, lowercase identifier for the area changed (e.g., `tests`, `docs`, `cli`).
- `<summary>` must be imperative, start with a lowercase letter, and be 72 characters or fewer.
- Body (if present) should wrap at 72 characters.
